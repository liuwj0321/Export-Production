# Export-Production
It is determined by NPP multiplied by the export ratio, Here are the three formulas of export ratio used
ef= 0.04756×(0.78-(0.43×SST)/30)×NPP^0.307, (Laws et al., 2011)                        (1)
ef= -0.0081×SST+0.0806×ln⁡(Chla)+0.426, (Dunne et al., 2005)                            (2)
ef= 8.57/(17.9+SST), (Li & Cassar, 2016)                                               (3)
